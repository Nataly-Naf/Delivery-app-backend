# Delivery-app-backend

Node js backend for Medicine delivery application

Our project entails the backend component of an application designed for purchasing medicines. This backend facilitates communication between the client-side application (such as a web or mobile app) and the database to manage orders and products.

### Commands:

npm start — start the server in production mode.
npm run start:dev — start the server in development mode.
npm run lint — run code linting with eslint. It should be executed before each PR and all linting errors should be fixed.
npm lint:fix — same as linting, but with automatic fixing of simple errors.

Technologies Used:

Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for developing the backend part of the application.
MongoDB: Flexible NoSQL database for storing information about users, products, and orders.
Mongoose: Library for working with MongoDB, providing convenient interaction with the database through schemas and data models.
